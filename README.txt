These are some of my solutions for Kattis, they're all correct and work within the time limit but not all of them are optimal.
A lot of these are very simple problems, mostly done to practice speed.
These are meant to be used for reference for other people trying to solve these problems and future reference for myself regarding certain algorithms.
